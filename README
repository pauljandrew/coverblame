Little script to take the output of nose's coverage tool and output a list of all authors with untested code

Input:

project.util.wha                                          74      0   100%   
project.util.json                                         11      5    55%   19-25

Output:

Paul Andrew - 5
--- project.util.json [19, 21, 22, 23, 24]
John Doe - 16
--- project.util.json [25]
